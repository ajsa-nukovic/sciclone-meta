Contents:

- **manuscript** contains the working copy of the manuscript describing the tool and it's application. It also contains all the scripts and data needed to reproduce the figures
- **tests** contains some rough tests for validating that the code still runs after making changes. (It's not unit testing, but it's better than nothing...)
